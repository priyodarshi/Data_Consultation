# Data_Consultation

A demo project, simulating a real time work environment, where the objective was to assist a pharmaceutical client in determining from which countries to begin their coronavirus vaccination rollout process, and to arrive at the decision in a data driven analytical approach.  


Approach:

The dataset provided by the client was cleaned and transformed using R and SQL. From that, the daily vaccination rate of countries, the cumulative vaccinations per capita or the vaccination population percentages were calculated and according to those, the country performing the best to vaccinate its population was determined. Then keeping that country as the benchmark, scores were assigned to other countries and they were used to determine the final outcome. The countries, with their assigned scores and cumulative vaccinations were plotted on a Tableau dashboard for better understanding.
